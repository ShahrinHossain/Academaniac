University of Alberta,Civil And Environmental Engineering - Petroleum Engineering,Accepted,15 Apr 2024,Fall 2024,Other,3.25,,"Canadian applicant, notified via email that I had a message in my portal. I applied back in late February. I completed my undergrad in environmental science at UofT and was honestly expecting a rejection due to a lack of fundamental engineering courses. I likely won't be accepting this, though, as there is no guaranteed internship/co-op like there are at Calgary and UBC which I have also applied to. Furthermore, I wasn't using my brain at the time of application but the petroleum industry is on its way out, so it probably isn't a great prospect for the future. Cool that I got accepted though."
