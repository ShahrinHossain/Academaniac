I wish success to everyone who is waiting for news. My advice to those who will apply next year is not to send an e-mail to only one professor when you apply. Notify all the professors in your field that you have applied by sending an e-mail. I didn't do this when I was applying, but I have seen from those who have been accepted from universities such as Harvard and Princeton that they present projects that they will not actually work on but will be of interest to the department. In this way, you can turn to projects that you will not actually work on, but that will attract the department's attention more and increase your chances of getting accepted. Especially gender is one of these topics..."
